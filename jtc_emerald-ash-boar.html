<p>
The Emerald Ash Borer is an exotic beetle originally from Asia that was disovered in southeastern Michigan near Detroit in the summer of 2002.
 The adult beetles nibble on ash foliage but cause little damage.
  The larvae feed on the inner bark of ash trees,
   disrupting the tree's ability to transport water and nutrients.
</p>
<p>
  The beetle is a bright metallic green and adults are typically 1/2 inch long and 1/8 inch wide.
  Eggs are aproxamately 1/25 inch and reddish brown in color. Their larvae are white and flat headed.
</p>
<p>
  Adults usually emerge in mid- to late-May from infestations to the trees during the previous year (earlier if the weather is warm),
   with females laying their eggs shortly after.
</p>
<p>
  Ash trees are one of the most valuable and abundant North American woodland trees: estimates of total number of ash trees in the United States alone range between seven and nine billion. The emerald ash borer has destroyed 40 million ash trees in Michigan alone and tens of millions throughout other states and Canada. Small trees can die as soon as one to two years after infestation, while larger infested trees can survive for three to four years. Heavy infestations of larval borers speed up the devastation of formerly healthy trees.
</p>
<p>
  As of October 2018, it is now found in 35 states, and the Canadian provinces of Ontario, Quebec, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Manitoba.
